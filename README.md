# Discord Notifyer Bot

## Purpose
Automatically pings channel of interest upon arrival of a server member in a VC. Removes the need to manually ping everyone.

## Function
The notifyer bot will, by default, ping the channel under the following circumstances:

1. The user has joined a voice channel having previously been in none,
2. No other users were present in the voice channel they joined,
3. A cooldown period of 5 mins has elapsed since the previous notification.
